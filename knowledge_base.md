# GET LOADED 256 KNOWLEDGE BASE

## 1a. Food Type
We serve authentic, slow-smoked BBQ with a twist. Our specialty is "Loaded" items—meaning we take massive portions of smoked brisket, pulled pork, or smoked chicken and pile them high on potatoes, fries, and nachos. Everything is loaded... but our cooks.

## 1b. Serving Area
We are based in Huntsville, AL (The Rocket City). We typically serve a 30-mile radius including Madison, Athens, Decatur, and Guntersville for private events and catering.

## 1c. Hours
Our schedule varies weekly because we are a food truck! 
* Lunch: 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM
* Dinner: Typically 5:00 PM - 8:00 PM
Check the "Truck Status" on our homepage for today's specific coordinates.

## 1d. About Us
Get Loaded 256 was born out of a love for big portions and better BBQ. We believe you shouldn't have to choose between quality smoked meats and a meal that actually fills you up. We stay mobile to bring the heat to the entire Tennessee Valley.
