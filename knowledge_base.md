## 1d. About Us
At Get Loaded, we believe if you can still see the plate, we haven't put enough food on it. We specialize in "Hard-Hitting BBQ"—that means premium meats smoked low and slow, then piled onto massive russet potatoes, crinkle-cut fries, or crispy nachos. We’re local, we’re loud, and remember: everything is loaded but our cooks.
